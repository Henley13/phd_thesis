	abstract = {Abstract Gene expression variability in mammalian systems plays an important role in physiological and pathophysiological conditions. This variability can come from differential regulation related to cell state (extrinsic) and allele-specific transcriptional bursting (intrinsic). Yet, the relative contribution of these two distinct sources is unknown. Here, we exploit the qualitative difference in the patterns of covariance between these two sources to quantify their relative contributions to expression variance in mammalian cells. Using multiplexed error robust RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (MERFISH), we measured the multivariate gene expression distribution of 150 genes related to Ca2+ signaling coupled with the dynamic Ca2+ response of live cells to ATP. We show that after controlling for cellular phenotypic states such as size, cell cycle stage, and Ca2+ response to ATP, the remaining variability is effectively at the Poisson limit for most genes. These findings demonstrate that the majority of expression variability results from cell state differences and that the contribution of transcriptional bursting is relatively minimal.},

	abstract = {Cells dedicate significant energy to build proteins often organized in multiprotein assemblies with tightly regulated stoichiometries. As genes encoding subunits assembling in a multisubunit complex are dispersed in the genome of eukaryotes, it is unclear how these protein complexes assemble. Here, we show that mammalian nuclear transcription complexes (TFIID, TREX-2 and SAGA) composed of a large number of subunits, but lacking precise architectural details are built co-translationally. We demonstrate that dimerization domains and their positions in the interacting subunits determine the co-translational assembly pathway (simultaneous or sequential). The lack of co-translational interaction can lead to degradation of the partner protein. Thus, protein synthesis and complex assembly are linked in building mammalian multisubunit complexes, suggesting that co-translational assembly is a general principle in mammalian cells to avoid non-specific interactions and protein aggregation. These findings will also advance structural biology by defining endogenous co-translational building blocks in the architecture of multisubunit complexes.},
