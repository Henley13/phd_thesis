	abstract = {The basis of cellular function is where and when proteins are expressed and in what quantities. Single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) experiments quantify the copy number and location of mRNA molecules; however, the numbers of RNA species that can be simultaneously measured by smFISH has been limited. Using combinatorial labeling with error-robust encoding schemes, Chen et al. simultaneously imaged 100 to 1000 RNA species in a single cell. Such large-scale detection allows regulatory interactions to be analyzed at the transcriptome scale. Science, this issue p. 10.1126/science.aaa6090 A single-molecule imaging method allows simultaneous measurement of 1000 RNA species in single cells. Knowledge of the expression profile and spatial landscape of the transcriptome in individual cells is essential for understanding the rich repertoire of cellular behaviors. Here, we report multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), a single-molecule imaging approach that allows the copy numbers and spatial localizations of thousands of RNA species to be determined in single cells. Using error-robust encoding schemes to combat single-molecule labeling and detection errors, we demonstrated the imaging of 100 to 1000 distinct RNA species in hundreds of individual cells. Correlation analysis of the ~104 to 106 pairs of genes allowed us to constrain gene regulatory networks, predict novel functions for many unannotated genes, and identify distinct spatial distribution patterns of RNAs that correlate with properties of the encoded proteins.}

Here we demonstrate an evolution of sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization (seqFISH+). We show that seqFISH+ can image mRNAs for 10,000 genes in single cells—with high accuracy and sub-diffraction-limit resolution—in the cortex, subventricular zone and olfactory bulb of mouse brain, using a standard confocal microscope. The transcriptome-level profiling of seqFISH+ allows unbiased identification of cell classes and their spatial organization in tissues. In addition, seqFISH+ reveals subcellular mRNA localization patterns in cells and ligand–receptor pairs across neighbouring cells. This technology demonstrates the ability to generate spatial cell atlases and to perform discovery-driven studies of biological processes in situ.},

	abstract = {The expression profiles and spatial distributions of RNAs regulate many cellular functions. Image-based transcriptomic approaches provide powerful means to measure both expression and spatial information of RNAs in individual cells within their native environment. Among these approaches, multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) has achieved spatially resolved RNA quantification at transcriptome scale by massively multiplexing single-molecule FISH measurements. Here, we increased the gene throughput of MERFISH and demonstrated simultaneous measurements of RNA transcripts from ∼10,000 genes in individual cells with ∼80\% detection efficiency and ∼4\% misidentification rate. We combined MERFISH with cellular structure imaging to determine subcellular compartmentalization of RNAs. We validated this approach by showing enrichment of secretome transcripts at the endoplasmic reticulum, and further revealed enrichment of long noncoding RNAs, RNAs with retained introns, and a subgroup of protein-coding mRNAs in the cell nucleus. Leveraging spatially resolved RNA profiling, we developed an approach to determine RNA velocity in situ using the balance of nuclear versus cytoplasmic RNA counts. We applied this approach to infer pseudotime ordering of cells and identified cells at different cell-cycle states, revealing ∼1,600 genes with putative cell cycle-dependent expression and a gradual transcription profile change as cells progress through cell-cycle stages. Our analysis further revealed cell cycle-dependent and cell cycle-independent spatial heterogeneity of transcriptionally distinct cells. We envision that the ability to perform spatially resolved, genome-wide RNA profiling with high detection efficiency and accuracy by MERFISH could help address a wide array of questions ranging from the regulation of gene expression in cells to the development of cell fate and organization in tissues.}

Oligodeoxynucleotide probes were synthesized with five fluorochromes per molecule, and the light emitted by a single probe was calibrated. Points of light in exhaustively deconvolved images of hybridized cells gave fluorescent intensities and distances between probes consistent with single messenger RNA molecules. Analysis of β-actin transcription sites after serum induction revealed synchronous and cyclical transcription from single genes. The rates of transcription initiation and termination and messenger RNA processing could be determined by positioning probes along the transcription unit. This approach extends the power of FISH to yield quantitative molecular information on a single cell.}

	abstract = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

In this paper, the authors review what is known of the nature of the localisation signals and the proteins that interact with them in animal cells. Specific examples are selected to illustrate the emerging pattern of how these signals are formed by the mRNA and the key RNA-binding proteins. The signals are usually restricted to relatively short regions of the 3′UTR, but their precise nature varies, with both sequence and structure playing key roles. Repeat motifs and functional redundancy also appear as common features of these signals. The trans-acting factors involved in localisation include proteins having other roles in nuclear events, proteins that shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and translational factors. In addition, there is evidence of homology among these proteins and the mechanisms of localisation across eukaryotic species.}",

	abstract = {Local mRNA translation is a post-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanism that enables autonomous control of local proteomes in subcellular compartments. This mechanism operates in neuronal dendrites and axons to regulate local proteomic homeostasis in response to extrinsic signals.Both developing and mature axons have functional protein synthesis and processing machinery, which may adopt specialized morphologies. The axonal transcriptome is unexpectedly complex and changes with developmental ageing and in response to injury.RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) transport specific mRNAs to axons in a translationally repressed state by binding to the cis-acting elements of mRNAs and to other components of RNA granules. Extrinsic cues influence axonal mRNA repertoires by regulating RBP-mediated axonal transport.Protein synthesis-inducing cues activate diverse signalling pathways that converge on mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), the master regulator of cap-dependent mRNA translation. Some guidance cues, such as ephrin A, inhibit mTOR activity and may act antagonistically. Only a selective pool of mRNAs is translated in response to a specific cue.Extrinsic cues are directly linked to translation by the direct binding between cell surface receptors and ribosomes. This mechanism may enhance the spatial precision and specificity of cue-induced mRNA translation.The differential translation model predicts that asymmetric synthesis of positive and negative regulators of cytoskeletal assembly mediates attractive and repulsive chemotropic turning responses of growth cones. Attractive cues (such as netrin 1 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)) induce asymmetric β-actin synthesis, and repulsive cues (such as semaphorin 3A (SEMA3A) and SLIT2) promote local synthesis of actin-depolymerizing proteins (such as RHOA and cofilin).Local synthesis of proteins that support mitochondrial function, such as nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins and lamin B2, may play important roles in axon maintenance. Target-derived extrinsic cues can increase local synthesis of mitochondrial proteins in distal axons in vitro, and sustained axonal synthesis of such proteins is required for axon maintenance in vitro and in vivo.The ability of axons to regenerate after axotomy is associated with their ability to locally synthesize proteins. Regenerative axons, such as peripheral axons, upregulate local protein synthesis after injury, whereas non-regenerative axons, such as adult central axons, downregulate protein synthesis.Nerve injury promotes local synthesis of transcription factors, such as signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), which are retrogradely transported into the nucleus and activate injury-responsive gene transcription. Molecular motor complexes that mediate this transport are also regulated by locally synthesized proteins, such as Ran-specific GTPase-activating protein (RANBP1), importin-β and vimentin.Compartmentalized cell culture systems have proved to be invaluable tools to advance our understandings of axonal mRNA translation. Novel techniques or inventive experiments that allow efficient and specific manipulation of axonal mRNA translation in live animals will facilitate extension of these findings to in vivo settings.},
