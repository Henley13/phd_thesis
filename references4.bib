	abstract = {Caveolae are plasma membrane invaginations whose formation requires caveolin-1 (Cav1), the adaptor protein polymerase I, and the transcript release factor (PTRF or CAVIN1). Caveolae have an important role in cell functioning, signaling, and disease. In the absence of CAVIN1/PTRF, Cav1 forms non-caveolar membrane domains called scaffolds. In this work, we train machine learning models to automatically distinguish between caveolae and scaffolds from single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) data. We apply machine learning algorithms to discriminate biological structures from SMLM data. Our work is the first that is leveraging machine learning approaches (including deep learning models) to automatically identifying biological structures from SMLM data. In particular, we develop and compare three binary classification methods to identify whether or not a given 3D cluster of Cav1 proteins is a caveolae. The first uses a random forest classifier applied to 28 hand-crafted/designed features, the second uses a convolutional neural net (CNN) applied to a projection of the point clouds onto three planes, and the third uses a PointNet model, a recent development that can directly take point clouds as its input. We validate our methods on a dataset of super-resolution microscopy images of PC3 prostate cancer cells labeled for Cav1. Specifically, we have images from two cell populations: 10 PC3 and 10 CAVIN1/PTRF-transfected PC3 cells (PC3-PTRF cells) that form caveolae. We obtained a balanced set of 1714 different cellular structures. Our results show that both the random forest on hand-designed features and the deep learning approach achieve high accuracy in distinguishing the intrinsic features of the caveolae and non-caveolae biological structures. More specifically, both random forest and deep CNN classifiers achieve classification accuracy reaching 94\% on our test set, while the PointNet model only reached 83\% accuracy. We also discuss the pros and cons of the different approaches.},

Here, we present DypFISH, an approach to quantitatively investigate the subcellular localization of RNA and protein. We introduce a range of analytical techniques to interrogate single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) data in combination with protein immunolabeling. DypFISH is suited to study patterns of clustering of molecules, the association of mRNA-protein subcellular localization with microtubule organizing center orientation, and interdependence of mRNA-protein spatial distributions. We showcase how our analytical tools can achieve biological insights by utilizing cell micropatterning to constrain cellular architecture, which leads to reduction in subcellular mRNA distribution variation, allowing for the characterization of their localization patterns. Furthermore, we show that our method can be applied to physiological systems such as skeletal muscle fibers.},

	abstract = {Single-cell transcriptomics has recently emerged as one of the most promising tools for understanding the diversity of the transcriptome among single cells. Image-based transcriptomics is unique compared to other methods as it does not require conversion of RNA to cDNA prior to signal amplification and transcript quantification. Thus, its efficiency in transcript detection is unmatched by other methods. In addition, image-based transcriptomics allows the study of the spatial organization of the transcriptome in single cells at single-molecule, and, when combined with superresolution microscopy, nanometer resolution. However, in order to unlock the full power of image-based transcriptomics, robust computer vision of single molecules and cells is required. Here, we shortly discuss the setup of the experimental pipeline for image-based transcriptomics, and then describe in detail the algorithms that we developed to extract, at high-throughput, robust multivariate feature sets of transcript molecule abundance, localization and patterning in tens of thousands of single cells across the transcriptome.

In particular, configuring image processing parameters for optimal cell profiling is susceptible to cognitive biases and dependent on user experience. Here, we use interactive machine learning to identify the optimum cell profiling configuration that maximises quality of the cell profiling outcome. The process is guided by the user, from whom a rating of the quality of a cell profiling configuration is obtained. We use Bayesian optimisation, an established machine learning algorithm, to learn from this information and automatically recommend the next configuration to examine with the aim of maximising the quality of the processing or analysis. Compared to existing interactive machine learning tools that require domain expertise for per-class or per-pixel annotations, we rely on users’ explicit assessment of output quality of the cell profiling task at hand. We validated our interactive approach against the standard human trial-and-error scheme to optimise an object segmentation task using the standard software CellProfiler. Our toolkit enabled rapid optimisation of an object segmentation pipeline, increasing the quality of object segmentation over a pipeline optimised through trial-and-error. Users also attested to the ease of use and reduced cognitive load enabled by our machine learning strategy over the standard approach. We envision that our interactive machine learning approach can enhance the quality and efficiency of pipeline optimisation to democratise image-based cell profiling.},

	Local translation allows spatial control of gene expression. Here, we performed a dual protein-mRNA localization screen, using smFISH on 523 human cell lines expressing GFP-tagged genes. 32 mRNAs displayed specific cytoplasmic localizations with local translation at unexpected locations, including cytoplasmic protrusions, cell edges, endosomes, Golgi, the nuclear envelope, and centrosomes, the latter being cell-cycle-dependent. Automated classification of mRNA localization patterns revealed a high degree of intercellular heterogeneity. Surprisingly, mRNA localization frequently required ongoing translation, indicating widespread co-translational RNA targeting. Interestingly, while P-body accumulation was frequent (15 mRNAs), four mRNAs accumulated in foci that were distinct structures. These foci lacked the mature protein, but nascent polypeptide imaging showed that they were specialized translation factories. For β-catenin, foci formation was regulated by Wnt, relied on APC-dependent polysome aggregation, and led to nascent protein degradation. Thus, translation factories uniquely regulate nascent protein metabolism and create a fine granular compartmentalization of translation.}
