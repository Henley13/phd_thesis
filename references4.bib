	abstract = {Caveolae are plasma membrane invaginations whose formation requires caveolin-1 (Cav1), the adaptor protein polymerase I, and the transcript release factor (PTRF or CAVIN1). Caveolae have an important role in cell functioning, signaling, and disease. In the absence of CAVIN1/PTRF, Cav1 forms non-caveolar membrane domains called scaffolds. In this work, we train machine learning models to automatically distinguish between caveolae and scaffolds from single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) data. We apply machine learning algorithms to discriminate biological structures from SMLM data. Our work is the first that is leveraging machine learning approaches (including deep learning models) to automatically identifying biological structures from SMLM data. In particular, we develop and compare three binary classification methods to identify whether or not a given 3D cluster of Cav1 proteins is a caveolae. The first uses a random forest classifier applied to 28 hand-crafted/designed features, the second uses a convolutional neural net (CNN) applied to a projection of the point clouds onto three planes, and the third uses a PointNet model, a recent development that can directly take point clouds as its input. We validate our methods on a dataset of super-resolution microscopy images of PC3 prostate cancer cells labeled for Cav1. Specifically, we have images from two cell populations: 10 PC3 and 10 CAVIN1/PTRF-transfected PC3 cells (PC3-PTRF cells) that form caveolae. We obtained a balanced set of 1714 different cellular structures. Our results show that both the random forest on hand-designed features and the deep learning approach achieve high accuracy in distinguishing the intrinsic features of the caveolae and non-caveolae biological structures. More specifically, both random forest and deep CNN classifiers achieve classification accuracy reaching 94\% on our test set, while the PointNet model only reached 83\% accuracy. We also discuss the pros and cons of the different approaches.},

We introduce a range of analytical techniques to interrogate single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) data in combination with protein immunolabeling. DypFISH is suited to study patterns of clustering of molecules, the association of mRNA-protein subcellular localization with microtubule organizing center orientation, and interdependence of mRNA-protein spatial distributions. We showcase how our analytical tools can achieve biological insights by utilizing cell micropatterning to constrain cellular architecture, which leads to reduction in subcellular mRNA distribution variation, allowing for the characterization of their localization patterns. Furthermore, we show that our method can be applied to physiological systems such as skeletal muscle fibers.},

	abstract = {Single-cell transcriptomics has recently emerged as one of the most promising tools for understanding the diversity of the transcriptome among single cells. Image-based transcriptomics is unique compared to other methods as it does not require conversion of RNA to cDNA prior to signal amplification and transcript quantification. Thus, its efficiency in transcript detection is unmatched by other methods. In addition, image-based transcriptomics allows the study of the spatial organization of the transcriptome in single cells at single-molecule, and, when combined with superresolution microscopy, nanometer resolution. However, in order to unlock the full power of image-based transcriptomics, robust computer vision of single molecules and cells is required. Here, we shortly discuss the setup of the experimental pipeline for image-based transcriptomics, and then describe in detail the algorithms that we developed to extract, at high-throughput, robust multivariate feature sets of transcript molecule abundance, localization and patterning in tens of thousands of single cells across the transcriptome.

In particular, configuring image processing parameters for optimal cell profiling is susceptible to cognitive biases and dependent on user experience. Here, we use interactive machine learning to identify the optimum cell profiling configuration that maximises quality of the cell profiling outcome. The process is guided by the user, from whom a rating of the quality of a cell profiling configuration is obtained. We use Bayesian optimisation, an established machine learning algorithm, to learn from this information and automatically recommend the next configuration to examine with the aim of maximising the quality of the processing or analysis. Compared to existing interactive machine learning tools that require domain expertise for per-class or per-pixel annotations, we rely on usersâ explicit assessment of output quality of the cell profiling task at hand. We validated our interactive approach against the standard human trial-and-error scheme to optimise an object segmentation task using the standard software CellProfiler. Our toolkit enabled rapid optimisation of an object segmentation pipeline, increasing the quality of object segmentation over a pipeline optimised through trial-and-error. Users also attested to the ease of use and reduced cognitive load enabled by our machine learning strategy over the standard approach. We envision that our interactive machine learning approach can enhance the quality and efficiency of pipeline optimisation to democratise image-based cell profiling.},

	Local translation allows spatial control of gene expression. Here, we performed a dual protein-mRNA localization screen, using smFISH on 523 human cell lines expressing GFP-tagged genes. 32 mRNAs displayed specific cytoplasmic localizations with local translation at unexpected locations, including cytoplasmic protrusions, cell edges, endosomes, Golgi, the nuclear envelope, and centrosomes, the latter being cell-cycle-dependent. Automated classification of mRNA localization patterns revealed a high degree of intercellular heterogeneity. Surprisingly, mRNA localization frequently required ongoing translation, indicating widespread co-translational RNA targeting. Interestingly, while P-body accumulation was frequent (15 mRNAs), four mRNAs accumulated in foci that were distinct structures. These foci lacked the mature protein, but nascent polypeptide imaging showed that they were specialized translation factories. For Î²-catenin, foci formation was regulated by Wnt, relied on APC-dependent polysome aggregation, and led to nascent protein degradation. Thus, translation factories uniquely regulate nascent protein metabolism and create a fine granular compartmentalization of translation.}

Here, we use high-throughput smFISH to screen centrosomal protein-coding genes, and we describe 8 human mRNAs accumulating at centrosomes. These mRNAs localize at different stages during cell cycle with a remarkable choreography, indicating a finely regulated translational program at centrosomes. Interestingly, drug treatments and reporter analyses reveal a common translation-dependent localization mechanism requiring the nascent protein. Using ASPM and NUMA1 as models, single mRNA and polysome imaging reveals active movements of endogenous polysomes towards the centrosome at the onset of mitosis, when these mRNAs start localizing. ASPM polysomes associate with microtubules and localize by either motor-driven transport or microtubule pulling. Remarkably, the Drosophila orthologs of the human centrosomal mRNAs also localize to centrosomes and also require translation. These data identify a conserved family of centrosomal mRNAs that localize by active polysome transport mediated by nascent proteins.},

	abstract = {RNA localization and local translation are important for numerous cellular functions. In mammals, a class of mRNAs localize to cytoplasmic protrusions in an APC-dependent manner, with roles during cell migration. Here, we investigated this localization mechanism. We found that the KIF1C motor interacts with APC-dependent mRNAs and is required for their localization. Live cell imaging revealed rapid, active transport of single mRNAs over long distances that requires both microtubules and KIF1C. Two-color imaging directly revealed single mRNAs transported by single KIF1C motors, with the 3â²UTR being sufficient to trigger KIF1C-dependent RNA transport and localization. Moreover, KIF1C remained associated with peripheral, multimeric RNA clusters and was required for their formation. These results reveal a widespread RNA transport pathway in mammalian cells, in which the KIF1C motor has a dual role in transporting RNAs and clustering them within cytoplasmic protrusions. Interestingly, KIF1C also transports its own mRNA, suggesting a possible feedback loop acting at the level of mRNA transport.},

	abstract = {Localization of RNAs to various subcellular destinations has emerged as a widely used mechanism that regulates a large proportion of transcripts in polarized cells. A number of methodologies have been developed that allow detection and imaging of RNAs at single-molecule resolution. However, methodologies to quantitatively describe RNA distributions are limited. Such approaches usually rely on the identification of cytoplasmic and nuclear boundaries which are used as reference points. Here, we describe an automated, interactive image analysis program that facilitates the accurate generation of cellular outlines from single cells and the subsequent calculation of metrics that quantify how a population of RNA molecules is distributed in the cell cytoplasm. We apply this analysis to mRNAs in mouse and human cells to demonstrate how these metrics can highlight differences in the distribution patterns of distinct RNA species. We further discuss considerations for the practical use of this tool. This program provides a way to facilitate and expedite the analysis of subcellular RNA localization for mechanistic and functional studies.},

	publisher = {JMLR.org},
	abstract = {Deep learning tools have gained tremendous attention in applied machine learning. However such tools for regression and classification do not capture model uncertainty. In comparison, Bayesian models offer a mathematically grounded framework to reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a prohibitive computational cost. In this paper we develop a new theoretical framework casting dropout training in deep neural networks (NNs) as approximate Bayesian inference in deep Gaussian processes. A direct result of this theory gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs - extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacrificing either computational complexity or test accuracy. We perform an extensive study of the properties of dropout's uncertainty. Various network architectures and nonlinearities are assessed on tasks of regression and classification, using MNIST as an example. We show a considerable improvement in predictive log-likelihood and RMSE compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and finish by using dropout's uncertainty in deep reinforcement learning.},
