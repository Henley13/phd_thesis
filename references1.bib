	abstract = {Images can be acquired at high rates with modern fluorescence microscopy hardware, giving rise to a demand for high-speed analysis of image data. Digital image cytometry, i.e., automated measurements and extraction of quantitative data from images of cells, provides valuable information for many types of biomedical analysis. There exists a number of different image analysis software packages that can be programmed to perform a wide array of useful measurements. However, the multi-application capability often compromises the simplicity of the tool. Also, the gain in speed of analysis is often compromised by time spent learning complicated software. We provide a free software called BlobFinder that is intended for a limited type of application, making it easy to use, easy to learn and optimized for its particular task. BlobFinder can perform batch processing of image data and quantify as well as localize cells and point like source signals in fluorescence microscopy images, e.g., from FISH, in situ PLA and padlock probing, in a fast and easy way.}

	year = {2022},
	doi = {10.1261/rna.079073.121},
	abstract ={Regulation of RNA abundance and localization is a key step in gene expression control. Single-molecule RNA fluorescence in-situ hybridization (smFISH) is a widely used single-cell-single-molecule imaging technique enabling quantitative studies of gene expression and its regulatory mechanisms. Today, these methods are applicable at a large scale, which in turn come with a need for adequate tools for data analysis and exploration. Here, we present FISH-quant v2, a highly modular tool accessible for both experts and non-experts. Our user-friendly package allows the user to segment nuclei and cells, detect isolated RNAs, decompose dense RNA clusters, quantify RNA localization patterns and visualize these results both at the single-cell level and variations within the cell population. This tool was validated and applied on large-scale smFISH image datasets, revealing diverse subcellular RNA  localization patterns and a surprisingly high degree of cell-to-cell heterogeneity.},
